# THIS PROJECT IS BEING ARCHIVED

## Original author

The original author of this project is [Matt Fisher](mailto:matt.fisher@fishworks.io).
Due to the massive amount of time and money he had to spend on this project he decided to stop working on it and [archived](https://github.com/fishworks/fish-food) it.

In the past I had already contributed some 'receipes' to the project [Fish Food](https://github.com/fishworks/fish-food), so I decided that I would try to keep the `Fish Food` and its companion project [GoFish](https://github.com/fishworks/gofish) still alive as long as possible.

# Fish Food

Core fish food for GoFish.

# How do I add my installable thingy to GoFish?

See https://gofi.sh/#cookbook for further information on adding your own fish food to GoFish.
